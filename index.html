It's possible that only one thing is different in this version and it's only visible using the inspect tool in your browswer. Every little thing is new to me and exciting. If I didn't send this to you, just to show you something dumb and small, then you can learn something about me from this paragraph as well. This is how I am. I get excited about little things that most would consider trivial.</p>

                        <p>I guess the short answer is that I don't really. I just come back to the same things over and over again until the cumulative adds up to some amount of knowledge. Just keep going. </p>
